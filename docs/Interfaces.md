# Interfaces for sophie app

## Introduction
This document describes the interfaces for the sophie app. It includes the user interface, application programming interface, and data interface.

## User Interface

The user interface for the sophie app will be a web app built using React. It will consist of the following components:

- users: A table of users who have created tasks.

The data interface will be secure and protect user data. It will be scalable and able to handle a large number of users. It will be reliable and available 24/7.

## Conclusion

The interfaces for the sophie app will consist of a user interface built using React, an application programming interface built using Node.js and Express, and a data interface using a PostgreSQL database. The interfaces will be secure, scalable, reliable, and available 24/7, with a focus on ease of use for the user. The user interface will be simple and intuitive, the API will be RESTful and communicate using JSON, and the data interface will be secure and protect user data. The interfaces will work together to provide a seamless experience for the user.
