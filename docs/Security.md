## 3. Security Controls

### 3.1 API Key Management
```plaintext
1. Key Storage:
   - Digital Ocean environment variables
   - Never in source code
   - Never in browser storage

2. Key Rotation:
   - Quarterly rotation required
   - Emergency rotation procedure documented
   - Zero-downtime rotation process
```

### 3.2 Data Protection
```plaintext
1. Client-side Storage:
   - Use localStorage for task data
   - No PII stored
   - Clear data option available

2. Data Transmission:
   - HTTPS only
   - API calls through secure endpoints
   - Minimal data transmission
```

## 4. Security Procedures

### 4.1 Key Rotation Procedure
1. Generate new API key in Anthropic console
2. Add new key to Digital Ocean environment
3. Verify functionality with new key
4. Remove old key from all environments
5. Document rotation in security log

### 4.2 Security Incident Response
1. Identify and isolate issue
2. Rotate compromised credentials
3. Document incident
4. Review and update security measures
5. Notify relevant parties

### 4.3 Security Audit Checklist
- [ ] API key storage verification
- [ ] Dependencies security scan
- [ ] Build process review
- [ ] Access control review
- [ ] Documentation update

## 5. Security Best Practices

### 5.1 Development
```plaintext
1. Code:
   - No hardcoded secrets
   - Input validation
   - Output sanitization

2. Testing:
   - Security test cases
   - Dependency scanning
   - Regular audits
```

### 5.2 Deployment
```plaintext
1. Environment:
   - Secure configuration
   - Access logging
   - Regular updates

2. Monitoring:
   - API usage tracking
   - Error logging
   - Security alerts
```
