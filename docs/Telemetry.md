# Telemetry for sophie app

## Introduction

This document describes the telemetry plan for the sophie app. It includes the telemetry goals, target audience, telemetry strategy, telemetry timeline, and success metrics.

## Telemetry Goals

The telemetry goals for the sophie app are as follows:

- To collect and analyze data on app performance and user behavior.
- To describe standards for monitoring and alerting on the app, including the use of OpenTelemetry for traces, logs, and metrics.
- To create tests for the app that can be run in a CI/CD pipeline to ensure that the app is performing as expected, and that the telemetry is in the app and working as expected.
- To monitor the app in production and detect any issues or incidents that arise.
- To provide insights into how users are interacting with the app and how it can be improved.

## Target Audience

The target audience for the sophie app telemetry is as follows:

- Developers who are responsible for maintaining and troubleshooting the app.
- Operations teams who are responsible for monitoring and managing the app in production.
- Anyone who needs to understand how the app is performing and how users are interacting with it.

## Telemetry Strategy

The telemetry strategy for the sophie app is as follows:

- Use telemetry tools such as OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and Grafana to collect and analyze app data.
- Set up dashboards and alerts to monitor app performance and detect issues in real-time.
- Monitor key metrics such as response time, error rate, and user engagement.
- Regularly review and analyze telemetry data to identify trends and areas for improvement.

## Telemetry Timeline

The telemetry timeline for the sophie app is as follows:

- Pre-launch: Set up telemetry tools and dashboards before the app goes live.
- Launch day: Monitor the app in production and address any issues or incidents that arise.
- Post-launch: Continue to monitor the app and make adjustments to the telemetry strategy as needed.

## Success Metrics

The success metrics for the sophie app telemetry are as follows:

- App uptime and availability.
- Response time and performance metrics such as latency and throughput.
- Error rate and number of incidents.
- User engagement metrics such as time spent in the app and number of tasks created.

## Conclusion

The telemetry plan for the sophie app includes the telemetry goals, target audience, telemetry strategy, telemetry timeline, and success metrics. By following this plan, we aim to collect and analyze data on app performance and user behavior, monitor the app in production, and provide insights into how users are interacting with the app. We will continue to monitor the success metrics and make adjustments to the telemetry strategy as needed to ensure a successful telemetry process.
