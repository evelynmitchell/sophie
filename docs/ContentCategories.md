## Suggested Document Organization

1. **Design Document**
   - High-level architecture overview
   - System context and constraints
   - Design decisions and rationale
   - References to other documents

2. **Requirements Document**
   - Tracked requirements with unique IDs
   - Traceability matrix
   - Verification methods

3. **Technical Specification**
   - Detailed implementation requirements
   - API specifications
   - Data structures

4. **Deployment Runbook**
   - Step-by-step deployment procedures
   - Environment configuration
   - Troubleshooting guides

5. **Security Documentation**
   - Security requirements
   - Security controls
   - Audit procedures

6. **Task Tracking**
   - GitHub Issues or similar
   - Sprint planning
   - Progress tracking

Would you like me to:
1. Create a proper requirements document with traceability?
2. Develop the deployment runbook?
3. Create a security documentation template?
4. Set up a GitHub Issues template for task tracking?
