# Deployment for sophie app

## Introduction

This document describes the deployment process for the sophie app. It includes the deployment goals, target environment, deployment strategy, deployment timeline, and success metrics.

## Deployment Goals

The deployment goals for the sophie app are as follows:

- To deploy the app to a production environment that is stable and secure.
- To ensure that the app is accessible to users and performs well under load.
- To monitor the app in production and address any issues or bugs that arise.

## Target Environment

The target environment for the sophie app is as follows:

- Cloud-based infrastructure such as netlify, vercel or Digital Ocean.
- (Web server running Node.js to serve the app.) I'd like to avoid this if possible, by using webpack to bundle the app and serve it statically.
- A local in browser storage, or sqlite as a in app db to store app data.
- Monitoring and logging tools to track app performance and errors.

## Deployment Strategy

The deployment strategy for the sophie app is as follows:

- Use a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the deployment process.
- Deploy the app to a staging environment first to test new features and changes.
- Use blue-green deployment to minimize downtime and risk during deployment.
- Monitor the app in production using tools that support OpenTelemetry.

## Deployment Timeline

The deployment timeline for the sophie app is as follows:

- Pre-deployment: Prepare the app for deployment by running tests, optimizing performance, and updating dependencies.
- Deployment day: Deploy the app to the production environment and monitor for any issues or errors.
- Post-deployment: Address any issues that arise, gather feedback from users, and continue to monitor the app in production.

## Success Metrics

The success metrics for the sophie app deployment are as follows:

- App uptime and availability.
- Response time and performance metrics such as latency and throughput.
- Error rate and number of incidents.
- User feedback and reviews on app performance and stability.

## Conclusion

The deployment process for the sophie app includes the deployment goals, target environment, deployment strategy, deployment timeline, and success metrics. By following this process, we aim to deploy the app to a stable and secure production environment, monitor its performance, and address any issues that arise. We will continue to monitor the success metrics and make adjustments to the deployment strategy as needed to ensure a successful deployment.
