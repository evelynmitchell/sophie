# Design Doc for sophie

## Introduction
This document describes the design of the sophie app. It includes the architecture, components, data flow, and user interface design.

## Architecture
The app will be built using a client-server architecture. The client will be a web app built using React, and the server will be a RESTful API built using Node.js and Express. The client and server will communicate using JSON.

## Components
The app will consist of the following components:
- User Interface: The web app will have a simple and intuitive user interface that allows users to create, prioritize, order, review, and mark tasks as done.
- Task List: The app will have a task list component that displays the user's tasks and allows them to interact with them.
- Task Form: The app will have a task form component that allows users to create new tasks.
- Task Item: The app will have a task item component that displays a single task and allows users to interact with it.

## Data Flow
The data flow in the app will be as follows:
1. User creates a task using the task form.
2. Task form sends a request to the server to create the task.
3. Server creates the task and sends a response to the client.
4. Client updates the task list with the new task.
5. User interacts with the task list to prioritize, order, review, and mark tasks as done.

## User Interface Design
The user interface will be designed to be simple and intuitive. It will consist of the following elements:
- Task List: A list of tasks that the user has created.
- Task Form: A form that allows users to create new tasks.
- Task Item: A single task that the user can interact with.

The user interface will be responsive and work on all devices. It will be user-friendly and easy to use, with clear instructions and feedback for the user.

## Conclusion

The design of the sophie app will be simple and intuitive, with a client-server architecture, components for the user interface, data flow for creating and interacting with tasks, and a responsive and user-friendly user interface design. The app will be built using React, Node.js, and Express, and will communicate using JSON. The design will be scalable, reliable, and secure, with a focus on ease of use for the user.
